Slide 4:
Title: What is a Requirement?
Contents:
- In simple terms, a requirement is a feature, a function, a service or a constraint. For example, requirements can mean the following: Feature/Function – element of the planned productService – a service the project needs to ensure it deliversConstraint – something that will act as a barrier during the project that needs to be planned for and suitable work arounds achieved.

Slide 5:
Title: Defining the Requirements
Contents:
- It is important to define a requirement along with its acceptance criteria as measurable targets at all levels. It is vital to give each requirement a unique ID, and keep the following details: Source; Owner; Business Benefit; and Priority.

Slide 6:
Title: Functional Requirements
Contents:
- Functional requirement is “what”, not “how”. It is important to make a requirement SMART: Specific; Measurable; Achievable; Realistic and Timely. It is also important to consider the wording of a functional requirement. For example, “We need the ability to …” or  “As a … I need… in order to …”. Functional requirements should not be in conflict with, or overlap, with other requirements.

Slide 7:
Title: Group Exercise: Functional Requirements
Contents:
- In small groups, consider the requirement; “set up a personal bank account”, Create some SMART requirements based on this from the perspectives of:The customerThe bank manager

Slide 8:
Title: Non-Functional Requirements – 1
Contents:
- Non-functional requirements are about “how well” we do the functional requirements. They are features that ensure a finished products work effectively and fits in well with the company brand, such as: SecurityAvailability Portability Maintainability

Slide 9:
Title: Non-Functional Requirements – 2
Contents:
- External interfacesDesign constraintsPerformanceResponse timeThey may be global or related to just one functional requirement. It is likely that they will require extra time in the plan.

Slide 10:
Title: Structure of Requirements – 1
Contents:
- Requirement DecompositionFeasibility – A very high level set of requirements is established.Foundations – A high level set of prioritised requirements is established (a PRL) and User stories.

Slide 11:
Title: Structure of Requirements – 2
Contents:
- Exploration and Engineering – Each requirement may decompose into more detailed requirements, and, at some point, it may not need to be written down, but evolved as part of iterative development (prototyping).

Slide 14:
Title: What is MoSCoW? – 1
Contents:
- Must haves are:  Fundamental to system;Without them, system unworkable/useless;Minimum usable subset;Guaranteed to be developed.

Slide 15:
Title: What is MoSCoW? – 2
Contents:
- Should haves include: Important requirements; Would be mandatory, but workaround exists;System will still be useful/usable without them.

Slide 16:
Title: What is MoSCoW? – 3
Contents:
- Could haves would add business benefit and are more easily left out of this increment than Should Haves. Won’t haves can be valuable requirements but can wait until a later increment.   Note:  All prioritisation is with respect to a clear project objective.

Slide 17:
Title: Get into groups of approximately 4. Revisit the exercise from Topic 6 where you listed 20 features your need in a house. Identify the functional and non-functional requirements, and then prioritise them using MoSCoW.
Contents:
- Group Exercise: Identifying requirements

Slide 18:
Title: The Requirement Lifecycle
Contents:
- Each requirement must be subject to:Elicitation – Workshops, model-building, interviews, observation, scenarios.Analysis – Realistic? Ambiguous? Combination of requirements? Aligned with business?Validation – Prototypes, reviews, models, testing.Management – Traceability, stability, change management.

Slide 19:
Title: Summary – 1
Contents:
- What is a requirement? A function, feature, service or constraintFunctional and non-functional requirementsFunctional = what not howNon-Functional = how wellRequirements in the DSDM lifecycleRequirements increase in number and detail throughout the lifecycle

Slide 20:
Title: Summary – 2
Contents:
- Requirements and modellingRequirements are broken down and demonstrated during modellingThe Requirement LifecycleElicitation/Analysis/Validation/Management

Slide 21:
Title: Topic 9 – Requirements Definition and Prioritisation
Contents:
- Any Questions?
