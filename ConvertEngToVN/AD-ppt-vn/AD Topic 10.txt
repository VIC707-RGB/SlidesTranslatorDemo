Slide 7:
Title: Perspectives for Iterative Development
Contents:
- Points to consider include:

Functional – the ‘what?’ not ‘how?’ elements of a project
Usability – the users needs and the user interface
Non-functional – the ‘how well?’ elements of a project

Slide 8:
Title: What is a Prototype? – 1
Contents:
- A prototype is:

An incomplete part of the total solution;
Used to learn more about what is required;
Evolutionary (evolving into the final solution) or disposable;
Evolutionary prototyping is the means of developing the solution as a set of increments, and learning by doing

Slide 9:
Title: What is a Prototype? – 2
Contents:
- The intent is to build something visible, valuable and working as soon as possible.

Slide 12:
Title: Iterative Development - Functional Perspective
Contents:
- Points to consider:
Focuses on functionality;
Developer demonstrates functional business requirements;
This checks developer’s understanding of user requirements;
Confirms ‘building the right solution’

Slide 13:
Title: Iterative Development - Usability Perspective
Contents:
- Points to consider:

Focuses on user interface
Illustrates solution ease of use
User tests ease of use of the solution

Slide 14:
Title: Iterative Development –
Non-Functional Perspective
Contents:
- It focuses on non-functional aspects (response time, security etc.) A solution developer tests that the solution meets non-functional requirements.

Slide 15:
Title: Capability/Technique Prototype
Contents:
- It focuses on technical design options and functionality. Here, a solution developer tests design approach and/or development tool.
- This is often an Architectural Spike or Proof of Concept.

Slide 17:
Title: Summary – 1
Contents:
- Here, we have considered the issues of iterative development, prototyping and evolutionary development strategies. Below is an outline of each term:

Iterative Development – the process of identifying; planning; evolving and reviewing the solution.  Iterative development allows for faster development and is one of the 5 key techniques used in Agile development.

Slide 18:
Title: Summary – 2
Contents:
- Prototyping – tools to demonstrate elements of the solution to allow for iterative development in-line with the users needs.
Evolutionary Development Strategies – the way in which iterative development is managed to ensure each layer of the solution architecture is addressed during iterative development.
