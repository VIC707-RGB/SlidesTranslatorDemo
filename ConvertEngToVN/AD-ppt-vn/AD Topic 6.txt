Slide 12:
Title: Where DSDM Reduces Risk
Contents:
- Traditional approaches use time contingency to reduce risk. Some Agile projects use NDUF (no design up front) and Traditional projects use BDUF (big design up front).

DSDM uses the EDUF (enough design up front) approach. It is because requirements are sometimes unknowable up front or are likely to change during the project.
