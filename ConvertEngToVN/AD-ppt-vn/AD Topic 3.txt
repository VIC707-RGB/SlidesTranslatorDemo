Title: What is a Model? - 2
Contents:
- Many industries use models (and prototypes) to establish requirements, confirm expectations and test the achievability of objectives. Examples of models include: storyboards; diagrams; scale models (prototypes); and working software (prototypes).

Slide 13:
Title: The 8 Principles of DSDM
Contents:
- Focus on business need
Deliver on time
Collaborate
Never compromise quality
Build incrementally from foundations
Develop iteratively
Communicate continuously and clearly
Demonstrate control

Slide 14:
Title: Exercise 3
Contents:
- In small groups of no more than 4, prepare a short presentation to last no more than TWO (2) mins
to link modelling to the 8 principles of DSDM.

Slide 15:
Title: Modelling Tips
Contents:
- Key points to consider are:

It is easily understood by user and developer;
It supports the process of incremental refinement;
Models produced must enhance communication;
It must fit easily within the Agile framework.

Slide 16:
Title: Summary of Modelling
Contents:
- What is modelling?
It is a visualisation process to build focus within a project.
Modelling perspectives
When, Why, What, Who, Where and How?
Modelling within the lifecycle
Used at all stages by differing stakeholders for varied reasons to ensure project objectives are met.
Modelling tips
Make it count! Modelling needs to be easy to understand and fit within all aspects of the life cycle.  It will greatly enhance communication.
