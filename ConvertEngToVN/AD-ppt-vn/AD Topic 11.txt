Slide 7:
Title: The Estimating Process
Contents:
- There are a number of distinct steps:

Estimate the effort required
Adjust the effort for environmental factors
Identify the products and their inter-dependencies
Schedule the product deliveries and allocate resource
Adjust the schedule in the light of known constraints

Slide 10:
Title: The Estimating Approaches - 1
Contents:
- Estimating approaches can be both top-down or bottom up and may include:
Task based
Product based
Algorithmic
Non-algorithmic
Analogy
Expert judgement
Standard ratios

Slide 11:
Title: The Estimating Approaches - 2
Contents:
- There are many different ways to identify estimates.  It is important to use more than one approach, and often will require many combined approaches to identify realistic estimates.

Slide 12:
Title: Why Are Estimates Wrong?
Contents:
- Inexperience of estimating
Doing something that has not been done before
Inadequate techniques
Optimistic assumptions
Wrong person making estimates
Lack of information

Estimates can be wrong by a small margin, but if they are not approached effectively there could be a large margin of error.

Title: Agree to what you believe you can do –









Then honour your commitments!

- Set realistic objectives!

Slide 16:
Title: What is a Timebox?
Contents:
- A timebox is a fixed period of time, at the end of which an objective has been met.


The time available dictates work done

The aim of a timebox is to make something useful

A timebox is product-focused, not task-focused

Slide 17:
Title: “Creative people in many walks of life have a deadline.
A magazine writer, television producer or seminar developer
creates material for a certain date ...






... Whatever else happens,
they must not fail to meet the deadline.”

Slide 20:
Title: Timeboxing
Contents:
- The estimated effort in the ‘Must Haves’ should never be above 75% (except in rewrites of well-documented systems).
- As a rule of thumb, within timeboxes within an increment:

Slide 21:
Title: Outline Plan created in Feasibility
Delivery Plan created in Foundations, showing timeboxes within the increment
Timebox Plans showing detailed activities within timeboxes, to monitor progress within timeboxes
Deployment Plan ‘outlined’ in Outline and Delivery Plans, created during Exploration and Engineering

Slide 24:
Title: Summary – 1
Contents:
- In this lecture, we looked at:

How do we estimate? - The class exercises allowed us to consider how we estimate and why experts should be responsible
The estimating process – we looked at how it is important to go through set steps; consider the affecting factors; work on them as a team and to ensure you use more than one approach.

Slide 25:
Title: Summary – 2
Contents:
- Planning the project – we looked at a suggested way to ensure that all the elements necessary are covered during the planning for a new increment
